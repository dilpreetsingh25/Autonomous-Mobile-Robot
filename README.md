# Autonomous Mobile Robot

This project is an implementation of an Autonomous Mobile Robot built using a Raspberry Pi 4 and an ESP32 microcontroller. The system combines onboard vision, sensor fusion, and motor control to navigate and interact with its environment without human intervention.

## Key Features:
Raspberry Pi 4 as the central processing unit

ESP32 used for low-level motor and sensor control

Real-time communication between Pi and ESP32 via serial or Wi-Fi

Camera module for visual input (e.g., ArUco marker detection)

Ultrasonic / IR sensors for obstacle avoidance

ROS 2 Humble integration (if applicable)

Remote monitoring and control via SSH or web interface

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
Python / C++

OpenCV for vision

MicroPython / Arduino for ESP32

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic middleware

Serial communication protocols (UART)
